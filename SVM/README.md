Uses `Svm` to carry out the tasks outlined in homework 4.
This file is meant to be run interactively running cells sequentially and can even be converted to a Jupyter notebook if desired (cells are denoted by # %%).
Though this file can also be run as a .py file.
Cells with long run times are indicated in all-caps.
The results from these cells were saved as a pickle object and can be loaded using specified cells (meaning can run rest of code).
The file can be run as a .py file as well but take very long due to cells with long run times.
